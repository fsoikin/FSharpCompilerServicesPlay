This repository was created with the sole purpose of providing a repro for [this StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36138883/f-compiler-services-incorrectly-parses-program).

The question concerns F# Compiler Services, and that thing requires quite a bit of preparation before you can actually call it, so all the code wouldn't fit in a SO question. This is why this repository exists.
